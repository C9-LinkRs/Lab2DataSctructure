# Lab2DataSctructure
In my opinion, a simple Lab

The lab (Laboratory) was created with a friend (Javier Valencia) y me. This is very simple:

The lab consist in a bank that has all the movement regist in a double linked list, all the nodes must has this information:

 + Date
 + Account number
 + amount
 
You have to create a interative menu with this options:

1. Query:
   * Calculate deposit amount realize in 2 dates given.
   * Calculate extracted money until current date.
   * Calculate the balance of a given account.
2.  Account cancelation: Eliminate the corresponding node of the account,for that, the balance must equals zero.
3.  Account creation: Create a new node with necessary information and insert in the corresponding place (double linked list must be      organized,don't create a auxiliar data structure for organize this, you can choose the order of organitation: upward or falling). The minimun amount to deposit in new account is 100000 COP$.
